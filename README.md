# FlightCheck Development
an IOS app specifically for providing pilots with a standard checklist before flight

# Development Progress:
  
  1. Begin with a simple start page. Details will be added later. Inlcude a button which 
  moves to a new page from the start page. 
  
  2. The new page will include a table list of planes available (currently 1, possibly 2 planes available.) that will be 
  accessible to the user. 
  
  3. Create a "Done" button which will travel to a new page. This new page will include the specific set of check items 
  for the pilot to check off. 
  
  4. Create a check box next to each option. Do not allow the user to skip over different items. 
  
  
  
  
  # Design Progress:
    
   1. Add PNGs of clouds and planes which will gentally float across the screen on the start page. Consider animations via 
   programming. Else, think about animation (GIF) of such items, and create a loop.
